This year I submitted two essays. One is Politics Question 1, "Is there such a thing as too much democracy?" The other, which I wrote later, is Philosophy Question 1, "Do we have any good reasons to trust our moral intuition?"

What motivated me for the Politics question:

The presidential election of the United States is on the horizon and Donald Trump is the leading Republican candidate. I have long held the opinion, that populism is equivalent to "democracy, when the academics dislike it". But this statement, while short and stout, is not satisfactory, for it ignores the history of representation from direct democracy to republics, and since I see some distinction, if not perfectly clear, in how "democracies" appeal to law and the constitution first while so-called "populist regimes" put the opinion of the public above written law. I would like to clarify these nebulous thoughts by writing this essay.

What motivated me for the Philosophy question:

Similar to what Prichard expressed in his essay "Does moral philosophy rest on a mistake?", I have found the subject of moral philosophy to be perplexing, as people seem to be creating "moral frameworks" and "principles" out of thin air. I took this question as an inquiry into whether my hypothesis that "intuition is the ultimate arbitrator for the thought of any individual" applies to morality and ethics.

What I've learned from writing both questions:

I have contently accomplished my goal of solidifying and articulating my thoughts on democracy and intuition, and I feel secure having analyzed and affirmed my thoughts. 
In addition, I am now more proficient in automatically managing bibliographies and document typesetting.
