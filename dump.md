Let us then proceed to differentiate between two interpretations of
moral intuitionism. Moral intuitionists often believe that

It cannot be denied, however, that intuitive judgment is occasionally
unreliable. But these are typically attributed to a lack of information.
For those who raise the example of a person whose moral principles are
considered ``utterly deranged'', it must also be noted how the
``expected'', or so called ``normative'' moral judgments as expected by
the people making this judgment, are no more fundamentally correct than
any other set of moral judgments, including those that are considered
``socially unacceptable''. A universal moral judgment for one moral act
among any set of different subjects cannot exist in a world that has
consistently overhauled its moral framework throughout the centuries,
and there is no evidence that we have reached any sort of stable
consensus on what moral acts are.

But if moral principles are up to each individual to decide, would there
be no consistency in society and no moral foundation for criminal
justice systems? My response would be that ``[the court's]
obligation is to define the liberty of all, not to mandate our own moral
code.'' \autocite[]{casey}.

\item
  Compare so-called ``better'' sources of intuition, perhaps even
  empiricism. Consider the individuality.
\item
  Perhaps an extended example on the trolley problem.
