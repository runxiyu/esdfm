Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the digital age,
 while the physical act of voting remains unchanged,
 the journey from ballots to voting booths has transformed dramatically.
 Previously,
 information was filtered through fact-checking systems,
 with respected newspaper editors and esteemed news anchors acting as gatekeepers to prevent the spread of deliberate falsehoods and inflammatory rhetoric.
 Today,
 the landscape is inundated with fake news and radicalized discourses,
 propelled by social media and the ubiquitous presence of cell phones.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The European Parliament election,
 one of the world's largest democratic exercises,
 saw a significant rise in far-right parties fueled by hyper-nationalism.
 In the US,
 the primary elections have shifted control over candidate selection from party leaders to popular votes,
 allowing extremist candidates and demagogues to enter the political arena.
 The election system's integrity was compromised,
 leading to the Capitol Hill insurrection,
 evoking memories of elected autocrats like Hitler and Hugo Chavez.
 This surge in populism and identity politics has stirred up significant unrest,
 prompting a crucial question:
 Is there an overdose of democracy,
 placing the reins of the country in the hands of inciting demagogues and misinformed,
 impulsive online mobs?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the answer is NO,
 indicating that democracy has not yet reached an excessive level,
 the subsequent question arises:
 Is there a theoretical possibility that there can be too much democracy?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Definition of Democracy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before evaluating the potential excess of democracy,
 it is essential to define what democracy entails.
 Throughout history,
 the definitions of democracy have evolved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Definition 1:
 Rule by the majority
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Originally,
 democracy was defined as rule by the majority.
 Aristotle identified three primary forms of government:
 kingship,
 aristocracy,
 and polity (with democracy as its deviant form) if the government consisted of one person,
 a few,
 or many,
 respectively (Lord 2013).
 In Athens,
 direct democracy was practiced through a citizen's assembly of 6000,
 with at least 40 annual conventions (Bao 2018).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Definition 2:
 Elective and Representative Democracy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To accommodate growing populations and overcome the inherent flaws of direct governance,
 egalitarian regimes evolved into representative democracies.
 Here,
 representatives govern the country through competitive elections into the legislature and administration (Schumpeter 1962).
 The general public participates indirectly in law-making and public policy by casting their votes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Definition 3:
 Liberal Democracy based on institutionalized constitution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more recent academic definition,
 known as Compound Democracy,
 Liberal Democracy,
 or Constitutional Democracy,
 emphasizes robust constitutions (Bao 2018).
 This model combines representative democracy with the rule of law,
 ensuring the legitimacy of political procedures,
 freedom of expression,
 citizen participation,
 and constraining administrative power within constitutional and legal principles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The key distinction between the second and third definitions of democracy is the presence or absence of the rule of law.
 If election procedures are abused,
 and political opponents are eliminated through imprisonment,
 exile,
 or death,
 the regime becomes an autocracy despite claiming to be a democracy.
 However,
 if public resentment is manipulated to defy the constitution and rule of law,
 the regime may maintain the appearance of elections and representation but falls short of being a Liberal Democracy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This research compares democracy with other common goods under the paradigms of Elective and Representative Democracy and Liberal Democracy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Measuring Excess of Democracy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The core issue of this research is determining the yardstick to measure how much democracy is too much.
 If democracy is considered an end in itself,
 it becomes excessive if it crowds out other inherent values of public life.
 If democracy is seen as a means to social prosperity,
 it is excessive if it overwhelms other means to achieve this goal,
 making it more elusive than in its absence or a mitigated presence.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Democracy as an End
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Democracy is valued for its intrinsic merit of citizen participation and decision-making as a social good,
 paralleling freedom,
 equality,
 economic prosperity,
 social cohesion,
 and public order.
 The benchmark for evaluating democratic excess is whether it allows other forms of common good to thrive,
 rather than overshadowing them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Globally,
 democracy remains scarce.
 In the Middle East,
 10 out of 12 countries have never experienced democracy.
 Asia hosts the largest number of countries (40%) that have never experienced democracy.
 Countries like Cambodia,
 Thailand,
 Pakistan,
 Turkey,
 and Russia have regressed from democracy to authoritarian regimes.
 Latin American countries such as Venezuela,
 Brazil,
 Argentina,
 and Chile have faced varying degrees of democratic
