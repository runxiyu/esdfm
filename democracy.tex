\section{Introduction}

The digital age has hardly changed the outlook of voting booths, but
the route from the ballots to voting booths has transformed enormously.
It used to be information flows screen-filtered by fact-checking systems,
and with respected newspaper editors and prestigious news anchors
as gatekeepers to keep out the most deliberate untruths and inflammatory
rhetoric. Today it is flooded by waves of fake news, radicalized and
radicalizing discourses unleashed by the advent of social media and
the convenience of cell phones. 

Democracy was on the ballot in the European Parliament election, one
of the world’s largest democratic exercises, and far-right parties
with hyper-nationalism were on the rise. The US primaries handed the
grip over candidate selection from party leaders to popular votes,
and opened the door to the Oval Office for extremist candidates and
demagogues. When the integrity of the election system was smeared
and the Capitol Hill insurrection was incited, the world smelled the
deja vu of elected autocrats like Hitler of the Third Reich and Hugo
Chavez of Venezuela. The surging populism and identity politics stir
up massive hatred and accentuate one question. 
\begin{quote}
Is there already an overdose of democracy that grabs the reins of
the country into the hands of inciting demagogues and misinformed,
impulsive online mobs? 
\end{quote}
If the answer is \emph{no}, democracy has not yet reached an excessive level
in the status quo, the subsequent question arises.
\begin{quote}
Is there a theoretical possibility that there can be too much democracy? 
\end{quote}

\section{Definition of Democracy}

Before evaluating the potential excess of it, it is essential to define
what democracy is. Definitions of democracy have been evolving throughout
human history. 


\begin{definition}[Democracy by rule of majority]
The original democracy is rule by the majority. Aristotle identified
three major forms of government: kingship, aristocracy, and polity
(the deviant of which is democracy) if the government consisted of
one person, a few, or a multitude respectively \autocite{arispol}.
In Athens, direct democracy of rule by the majority was practiced
through a citizen's assembly sized 6000, with at last 40 annual conventions \autocite{Bao2018}. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Elective and Representative Democracy]
To accommodate growing population and to overcome the inherent flaws
of direct governing by the people, the egalitarianism regime where
people made decisions together evolved into representatives governing
the country through competitive election into legislature and administration
\autocite{capsocdem}. The rank and file participate indirectly in
making laws and public policies by casting their votes. Grassroots
democracy has been replaced by representative democracy. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Liberal democracy based on institutionalized constitution]
There has been a new academic definition of democracy, the Compound
Democracy, also known as Liberal Democracy or Constitutional Democracy
for the established and robust constitutions \autocite{Bao2018}. The
formula is representative democracy coupled with the rule of law,
which safeguards the legitimacy of political procedures, freedom of
expression and citizen participation, and constrains administrative
power within constitutional and legal principles. 
\end{definition}


The defining line between the second and the third definition of democracy
lies in the absence or presence of the rule of law. If election procedures
are abused, political opponents are eliminated through imprisonment,
exile, or death, the regime has become an \emph{autocracy} despite its claim
to democracy. However, if public resentment is fermented and maneuvered
to defy the constitution and rule of law and hijack governmental polices,
the regime may maintain the appearance of election and representation
of the people, but falls short of Liberal Democracy. 

This research is a comparative analysis of democracy versus other
common good under the paradigms of Elective and Representative Democracy
and Liberal Democracy. 

\section{Yardstick to measure how much is too much}

The core issue of this research is the yardstick to measure how much
democracy is too much. If democracy is considered an end in itself,
it becomes excessive if it crowds out other inherent values of public
life. If democracy is seen as means to social prosperity, it is excessive
if it overwhelms other means to achieve this goal, making it more
elusive than in its absence or mitigated presence. 

\section{Democracy as ends}

Democracy is valued for its intrinsic merit of citizen participation
and decision-making as a social good. Its importance is parallel to
freedom, equality, economic prosperity, social cohesion and public
order. The benchmark for evaluating democratic excess is whether it
allows other kinds of common good to flourish as well, rather than
overshadowing them. 

Global landscape of democracy shows that vast regions are still short
of democracy. 10 out of 12 countries in the Middle East have never
experienced democracy. Asia is home to the largest number of countries
(40\%) that have never experienced democracy at any time in their
history. Countries like Cambodia, Thailand, Pakistan, Turkey and Russia
have regressed from democracy into authoritarian regimes. Venezuela,
Brazil, Argentina, Chile and multiple other Latin American countries
have experienced different degrees of democratic backslide \autocite{IDEA}.
Therefore, in vast regions of the world, democracy is a scarcity rather
than an excess. 

However, in highly democratic regions of the world like North America
and Europe, the rise of populist, extremist and anti-establishment
candidates or parties is eroding people's trust in the government
and the entire constitutional institution. Populism is seen as malaise
or an overdose of democracy. Here comes a crucial question of the
differentiation of populism from liberal democracy. Populism still
goes through representative legislature and administration through
competitive election (Definition 2), but it goes out of line with
Definition 3 of democracy (Liberal democracy based on institutionalized
constitution). Populist actors often disrespect accountability institutions
that check government, protect political pluralism and constitute
liberal democracy. Public opinions malnourished by misinformation
and lack of deliberation, or intentionally manipulated by demagogues
hijack election and government polices against the guardrails of constitution
and rule of law. Populism may look like democracy pro forma, but actually
gnaws at the bones of liberal democracy. 

Therefore, under the paradigm of liberal democracy, the raging populism
in North America or Europe is manifestation of democratic fragility
and erosion, rather than democratic overdose. 

\section{Democracy as means}

John Stuart Mill thinks that democracy is best suited to promote the
common good in two ways. It first plays an important epistemic role
in identifying the common good. Universal suffrage and political participation
provide the best assurance that the interests of the governed will
be properly appreciated by political decision-makers. Secondly, the
political participation also improves the moral capacity of citizens.
The governed cultivate their deliberate capacity to exchange reasons
with others and to take principled stands in political process\autocite{Mill_2010}
.

Democracy is commonly acknowledged today as means to achieving common
good as economic growth, economic equality, gender equality, freedom,
education, lower crime rate. However, disproportionately huge importance
attached to it is likely to overwhelm other effective means to these
targets and thus make the targets even harder to achieve. The following
part will analyze the inefficiency of democracy as means to prosperity. 

\subsection{Democracy is not sufficient in achieving prosperity}

Democracies are by and large more affluent, more equal and less corrupt
than non-democracies and hybrid regimes. Europe and Latin America
have the highest representation of women in parliament \autocite[6]{IDEA},
while the democratically starved Middle East literally imposes gender
apartheid. Civil liberties are one of the best-performing aspects
of democracy including in Africa. 

However, ``in and of itself, democracy is not sufficient to guarantee
low levels of corruption: indeed, 25 per cent of democracies globally
suffer from high levels of corruption'' \autocite[3]{IDEA}. Latin
America has the highest socioeconomic inequality and highest crime
rates. The US has seen intense working class's sense of victimhood
and economic anger since they were left behind in free capital flow
of globalization. The old beacon of hope has been more stratified
and polarized in the past decade than ever before. Democracy does
not translate into equality or prosperity. 

\subsection{Democracy is not the only means to prosperity}

Authoritarian regimes like Park Chung-hee's reign worked the Miracle
of Han River of Korea in the 1960s and 70s. China has leaped to be
the second economic powerhouse through 40 years of spectacular economic
growth. Lee Kuan Yew, celebrated as the architect of modern Singapore,
transformed Singapore from a modest port into a global financial and
transportation center with enormous improvement of people's living
standards and education. 

One the other hand, when countries with weak administration or antagonized
racial or religious groups are thrust into democracy, they suffer
schism, social turmoils and even coup. For example, Haiti copied American
constitution and the entire political system, but ended up being one
of the poorest and most corrupted countries in the world with political
turmoils one after another. Cambodia’s multi-party election democracy
plunged into a de facto one-party authoritarianism in 2017 due to
its weak state capacity. Democracy was imposed but collapsed for absence
of competent government. Even in established democracies, the rein
of effective state over democracy matters. The fact that Brexit mandated
by a referendum took three Prime Ministers to deliver showcases the
disastrous aftermath of a disrupted cabinet. 

Therefore, to both new and established democracies, effective state
is a very important prerequisite to social prosperity. Edmund Burke
claims that good government is more important, and indeed more valued
by the people, than self government \autocite[70]{scand}. When democracy
is prioritized over state building, there is an overdose of it and
the prospect of the country is doomed. 

Besides state building, there are other factors essential for social
cohesion and prosperity. ``Institutions were more than just formal
rules; they encompassed the shared understanding of appropriate behavior
that overlay them'' \autocite[213]{demdie}. Political party's forbearance
not to leverage its full power to cripple its political adversaries,
mutual respect and tolerance of political candidates are tacit procedural
principles that make the democratic institutions function. The media's
rigorous gate keeping system guarantees the public access to information
and fair analysis. The public's willingness to deliberation and rational
exchange of opinions keeps them from the trap of echo chamber and
online violence. All these are unwritten norms that orchestrate to
make the social soil fertile for the growth of democracy and prosperity.
If these unwritten norms of a civil society are shattered by economic
disparity and political polarization, the affluence of democracy is
likely to lead the country astray.

\section{Conclusion}

If democracy is taken as end, it is not excessive either in global
landscape or in established democracies. Many regions in this world
are starving for democracy. In established democracies, the surging
populism represents erosion of the backbones of liberal democracy,
not excess. 

If democracy is taken as means, it does not warrant social prosperity,
nor is it the only means to prosperity. The formula to prosperity
is state building, constitutional democracy, civil society with unwritten
norms of forbearance, tolerance and public civility. For regimes with
severe social stratification or racial or religious conflicts, the
importance of liberal democracy submits to that of a strong government
to contain the situation to the track of development. If the fertile
soil of forbearance in established democracies is damaged, and the
symmetry of the formula is broken with democracy being prioritized
at the expense of other means and becoming the only game in town,
the orgy of democracy paves the way to abyss. It is too early to say
the symmetry in established democracies in North America and Europe
has already been tilted, but there is a likelihood that it could be.
Democratic backsliding could begin at the ballot box. 

Democracy not only dies in darkness, as the masthead of the Washington
Post states. Democracy also dies in excess.
