# Do we have any good reasons to trust our moral intuition?

Let us first establish, that many of us already routinely trust our
moral intuition, for the common process of developing or considering the
validity of a moral principle often consists of testing moral dilemmas
based on intuition, and thereby refining the principle or rejecting it
when it yields a result or reasoning that we consider "absurd". Two
examples: I reject Kant's absolute prohibition against lying, as I
intuitively find it absurd to forbid myself from lying to a murderer who
threatens to find and kill my friend; and I initially reject
dogmatically applying classical utilitarianism due to intuitive
counter-examples, such as the intuitive immorality of pushing a heavy
person off a bridge to stop a runaway trolley \parencite[21]{justice}.

But there are, of course, more abstract (as opposed to specific thought
experiments) and logical <++>

## Universal or individual intuitions

- "There should be moral principles that are self-evident and everyone
  should intuitively arrive at the same set of principles"
- "People may naturally arrive at moral principles"

## Revisiting the trolley problem

- 

## Intuition as lazy (unexplained) empiricism
