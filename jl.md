# Do we have any good reasons to trust our moral intuition?

Let us first observe that many of us already routinely trust our moral
intuition, for the common process of developing or considering the
validity of a ethical principle often consists of testing moral dilemmas
based on intuition, and, in doing so, refining the principle or
rejecting it when it yields a result or reasoning that we consider
"absurd". Take two examples: I reject Kant's absolute prohibition
against lying, as I intuitively find it absurd to forbid myself from
lying to a murderer who threatens to find and kill my friend; and I
initially reject dogmatically applying classical utilitarianism due to
intuitive counter-examples, such as the intuitive immorality of pushing
a heavy person off a bridge to stop a runaway trolley (as describe in
\runcite[21]{justice}).

Let us then make a distinction between two notions of trusting moral
intuition. One is the notion that moral intuition is self-evident and
that any "sane" human would arrive at a set of common moral principles.
Another is the notion that moral intuition is idiosyncratic to each
individual. I argue for the latter in this essay, and in fact, rather
than thinking of moral intuition as a means to arriving at a
pre-conceived notion of what morality is, I argue that an individual's
moral intuition itself is the only source of truth for moral judgement.

Moral judgement is only applicable to individual, tangible events.

But there are, of course, more abstract (as opposed to specific thought
experiments) and logical <++>

## Universal or individual intuitions

- "There should be moral principles that are self-evident and everyone
  should intuitively arrive at the same set of principles"
- "People may naturally arrive at moral principles"

Let us then proceed to differentiate between two interpretations of
moral intuitionism. Moral intuitionists often believe that
